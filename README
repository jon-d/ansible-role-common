ansible-role-common
===================

This ansible role configures a debian system to meet the expectactions of
every roles you will find in my repositories.

Especially :

  - the network configuration is in /etc/network/interfaces.d/
  - the members of the ``sudoer`` group can sudo without password
  - ssh listen on the admin network interface only
  - the nfs utils are removed and are no longer running.

In the network environment this roles have been built, every machine is
accessed only via a dedicated admin network. The admin network is also used
to deploy the machines and can be used to access all the common services
(dns, mail relay, etc.) but nothing can enter this network, so the services
hosted on the machines listen on other interfaces, in other networks.


Configuration
-------------

common_default_internal_route (W.X.Y.Z/0, no default)-> route to join internal resources, for specific
routing when a machine has a default route which does not allow to reach
internal resources.

common_admin_netmask (default = 255.255.255.0)
